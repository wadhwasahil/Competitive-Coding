See the questions lies on the following observation.
Given n , l and r.

Let x=l-r+1
a[i]=no of non decreasing subsequences of length i 
it can be figured out that a[i]=(x+i-1)Ci
where nCr is also termed as n selects r.
So overall is :

F(n)=a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]...+a[n]=(x)C1 + (x+1)C2 + ........  (x+n-1)Cn 

using hockey stick theorem, it can be reduced to F(n)=(n+x+1)Cn - 1
